## ⚒️ Main Process

1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3️⃣ SQL/ Python Analysis 

👉🏻 First, explain codes' purpose - what they do in 1, 2 short sentences.

*_Example_*

## Task 1: Analyze bounce rate...

Bounce rate represents the percentage of website sessions where users visit only one page and leave without interacting further with the site. A high bounce rate can indicate that visitors are not [....]

**_📌You need to show your understanding/ thinking process when you do this analysis. In the above exp, I explain the meaning of Bounce Rate in Marketing performance analysis - which demonstrates my understanding about the metric & its role in my projects/ flow of analysis"_**
**_📌If the task is just simple as "Remove duplication, Replace null value.."--> Summarize all steps related to Transforming & Cleaning data steps in a group & explain shortly at once the reason why you need that transformation_**

👉🏻 Then how your query/ code & Insert screenshots of your result

 **_If your result is a very long table with many records, only show top 5/10 and bottom 5/10 rows, or records that relevant to the insights/ observation below_**
